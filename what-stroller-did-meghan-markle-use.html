            <p> While we may not get to see the Duchess of Sussex rocking a stroller on her upcoming royal tour, she did have one with her while she was pregnant with Prince Harry. In fact, she even took it with her to visit her parents at their home in North Wales. This adorable stroller is the Bugaboo Cameleon and it’s perfect for parents who want to travel light. It folds up easily and can be stored just about anywhere.</p><h3>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s first child was born in September 201and the royal couple was excited to reveal the name to the world to mark the occasion.</h3><p> Meghan used a Bumba, a brand that’s been around since 1989 and is known for being a high-quality baby stroller. It’s a lightweight stroller that’s easy to maneuver, making it the perfect choice for mom-to-be walking around town.</p><h3>The name was revealed at Kensington Palace, and Markle said she specifically wanted to name her firstborn after Harry’s paternal grandfather, “a lovely, kind, generous and funny man.”</h3><p> Her most adorable accessory was definitely her “baby bump” stroller. As you may have noticed, the bump is a little hard to spot under the long white coat she often wore when she and Harry were out and about. And she definitely didn’t let the coat stop her from showing off her baby bump!</p><h3>Kensington Palace shared photos of Markle and Harry with their newborn in the snowy St. George’s Chapel at the palace.</h3><p> It’s a very British tradition for the new parents to use a pram in the chapel, and it’s believed that it’s a way of showing humility. The Kensington Palace Twitter account shared a photo of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex with their newborn in the snowy St. George’s Chapel at the palace. The duchess has been spotted carrying the royal baby in the same white, navy blue and burgundy carriage that she used with Prince George when he was born. The little white stroller was a gift from the Queen and Prince William, and it was previously used by the Queen for Princess Diana when she was a new mother as well.</p><h3>Markle and Harry selected the gorgeous name Grace because it “means graceful, gracious and strong.”</h3><p> In May 2019, the Royal Couple revealed which stroller they had used when they traveled to Africa on a humanitarian mission in 2018. The pair rented a Bullet from Aptein and Baby Care, a company that sells high-quality strollers, car seats and other baby products. If you want to buy a used Bullet stroller, check out our guide to the best used strollers for 2020.</p><h3>Markle also shared photos of her and Harry at the time of their daughter’s birth on Instagram, writing “A dream come true.”</h3><p> The royal family has a long-held tradition of carrying out important duties in baby strollers. In this case, the new mom chose a style known as a “Togster” from British designer Tog. The Togster is a lightweight stroller made from natural materials that can be used in any weather, from the hottest of summers to the chilliest of winters.</p><h3>Markle used a brand-new stroller to take her newborn out for a stroll.</h3><p> The royal baby was out in the world for his first official outing in a new stroller on Monday, May 14. The new stroller was a gift from the royal family for the new parents. It’s called the Babyzen Car Seat Co-Sleeper and is made by French company Céline. The stroller is a lightweight, single-stroller that has a unique reclining car seat design. The seat can be reclined to a comfortable angle for naps and feeds.</p><h3>Markle and Harry went to the Chelsea Flower Show together, and she was all smiles as she sat in the garden section with her newborn.</h3><p> This is the question we’ve all been wondering! The Duchess of Sussex was photographed in her new baby carrier, which was first spotted at the Royal Family’s annual Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace. The brand is called “BabyTog” and it’s quite similar to the one that Princess Charlotte was spotted using when she was born. The carrier is made from 100% natural fabrics and has been created to help babies feel secure and to help them develop.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p> In May 2018, the Duchess of Sussex revealed that she had given birth to her baby girl. The news came as a complete surprise, and the world was left wondering which brand of stroller she used to carry her little one around in.</p>
